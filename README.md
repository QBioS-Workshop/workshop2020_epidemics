# QBioS Virtual Workshop: Epidemics


This GitHub serves as a repository for the **introductory programming notebooks**, and a handy-way for us to provide support before the [QBioS 2020 Virtual Workshop](http://workshop2020.qbios.gatech.edu/) on May 18!

If you have any issue with the code, or want help understanding a piece of code. Please create a new **Issue**, explaining it to us, with the appropiate labels (use MATLAB, Python or R depending on your programming language choice), and we will help you shortly!
